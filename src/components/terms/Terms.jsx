            An Accommodation Reservation is a limited license to enter, occupy,

            to re-enter the Accommodation during your stay, to the extent: (i)
            it is reasonably necessary, (ii) permitted by your contract with the
            Accommodation, and (iii) consistent with applicable law. If you stay
            past checkout, the Accommodation has the right to make you leave in
            a manner consistent with applicable law, including by imposing
            reasonable overstay penalties. You may not exceed the maximum number
            of allowed Guests. Accommodation Reservations also extend to the
            hotels, lodges, camps, tented lodges and other housing.

            Except where expressly authorized, you may not allow any person to

            In general, if as a Guest you cancel a Reservation, the amount
            refunded to you is determined by the cancellation policy (as
            determined by PipitSafaris and the Tour Operator) that applies to
            that Reservation. However, in certain situations, other policies
            take precedence and determine what amount is refunded to you. If the
            Tour Operator cancels, or you experience a Travel Issue (as defined
            in our Guest Refund Policy), you may be eligible for rebooking
            assistance or a partial or full refund, depending on the
            circumstances as evaluated by PipitSafaris.
          </Text>
          <Text theme={theme}>
            All cancellations are subject to the Supplier Terms and Conditions
            of the Third Party Suppliers. Some Third Party Suppliers may choose
            to offer future travel credits in lieu of a cash refund. We,
            PipitSafaris, are not liable for a Third Party Supplierâ€™s failure to
            provide a refund or for Third Party Supplier insolvency or
            bankruptcy.
